# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction | Self Project

> **Timeline:** Junâ€™24 â€“ Julâ€™24  
> Developed an ML-powered model for forecasting stock price trends using **RNN** and **LSTM**, integrating **technical indicators** to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Build a **stock price prediction model** using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.
- Leverage indicators like **RSI, MACD, and moving averages** to improve model accuracy and forecast reliability.

---

## ðŸ§© Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Collected and cleaned historical stock price data.
   - Engineered price trends, volatility measures, and technical indicators.

2. **Model Development**  
   - Built RNN and LSTM-based architectures to capture time-series dependencies.
   - Used sliding windows for input-output sequence creation.

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Measured performance using **RMSE** and **R-squared** metrics.
   - Estimated prediction confidence intervals to quantify uncertainty.
